# Policing the California Outer City

This repo allows for the reproduction of the analysis described in my manuscript: "Policing the California Outer-City: Drivers of Police Spending in a Changing Metropolis."

The "data" folder includes my original panel data set and the "analysis" folder has the main script I used to generate all of the tables and figures in the paper.
